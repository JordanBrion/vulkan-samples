This repo contains very simple sample projects to manipulate Vulkan API (via ash crate) in Rust.

You will need the Vulkan SDK from LunarG (https://www.lunarg.com/vulkan-sdk/) and SDL2.

The samples were only tested on Debian 9.11.

NB: the source code is clearly not ready for production use (eg. I do not free Vulkan objects at all)
